## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_hex()
ggsave("diamonds.pdf")

write_csv(diamonds, "diamonds.csv")
```

#need to install the hex package from the store for this code chunk to run
```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("diamonds.pdf")

write_csv(diamonds, "diamonds.csv")
```


#need to go manually and create a folder out in the directory so that this chnk can run and assign the files
```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_hex()
ggsave("out/diamonds.pdf")

write_csv(diamonds, "out/diamonds.csv")
```

#by wrapping the assigmnent it also prints out the output
#(proj <- 3*sin(pi/4)) gives the answer
#use single digits when need throwaway variables to store values temporarrily
#three letter variabvles are better 

#camelCase, snake_case, multiple words while assigning varibale names

#R.uses.periods, use snake_case, hate periods, have no meaning here unlike other languages 

#type Alt+dash symbol willl insert the assignment operator
